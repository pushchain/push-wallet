## Overview

Push Keys offer a robust architecture for managing cryptographic keys in a secure environment, allowing users to interact with any blockchain network through a unified user profile. The architecture emphasizes security, usability, and interoperability, ensuring seamless user experience across Web3 applications while maintaining high performance and security standards.

## Architecture

### 1. **Key Generation**

- Keys are generated using BIP-39 mnemonic phrases and BIP-32 hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets.
- This method allows easy backup and restoration of keys using mnemonic phrases, supporting infinite key derivations for various purposes within the Push network.

### 2. **Key Interaction**

- Keys are managed within a secure, isolated iFrame environment.
- The isolated environment ensures keys are never exposed, significantly enhancing security.

### 3. **Enabling Multi Wallet Account Management**

- Push Key architecture integrates different wallet addresses, allowing each to sign data within the secure environment.
- A derived key from the master key is encrypted for all linked wallet accounts, facilitating seamless transaction mapping for individual wallets and the unified user.

### 4. **Simplifying UX with Session Keys**

- Session keys are generated to improve UX by reducing direct interaction with the secure environment.
- While session keys simplify user interactions, they can be automatically or manually revoked to balance security and usability.

### 5. **Data Encryption**

- Transaction data can be encrypted using the derived public key of the unified user to ensure private and secure communication between participants.
- This process protects sensitive information, ensuring confidentiality and security.

### 6. **Key Rotation and Revocation**

- Mnemonic owners can change derived keys, effectively resetting all connected accounts, a process known as key rotation.
- This feature, along with session key revocation, ensures ongoing security by allowing users to mitigate risks if any key is compromised.

### 7. **Key Storage**

- **Mnemonic Custody**: The mnemonic phrase is not stored and remains solely with the user.
- **Unified User Details Storage**: Unified user details, along with the master public and derived public keys, are stored on Push storage nodes.
- **Web3 Account Registration**: Web3 accounts are linked to the unified user through transactions, with encrypted derived keys associated with each account.
- **Session Key Registration**: Session keys for Web3 apps are registered and linked to the unified user.
- **Key Rotation and Revocation**: Users can reset or revoke derived keys and session keys to maintain security and control.
